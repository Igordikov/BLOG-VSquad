<div class="fun-fact">
    <h3>Fun fact!</h3>
    <p class="fun-fact-content">3D modeling was first used in the film industry in 1968 to create
         special effects in the film "2001: A Space Odyssey." This film was one of the first to use computer 
         technology to create visual effects. Since then, technology has advanced greatly and is now used everywhere from games to medicine.
    </p>
</div>



<h2>Basic Steps to Modeling a 3D Character</h2>
<p>The first step in creating a 3D character is to develop concept art and initial design. This stage is extremely important because it sets the visual direction for the entire model. Without a good concept, it is easy to lose focus on detail and proportions, which will make further work difficult. This is where you learn how to make a character that aligns with the vision of the game or project.</p>




<h3>Step 1. Concept Art and Initial Design</h3>
<p>In turn, it includes:</p>

   
        <h4><b>1. Research and collection of references</b></h4>
        <p>Before you start drawing a concept, it is important to collect all possible reference images that will help form the overall image of the character. These can be photos of real people to study anatomy and skin texture, other characters from films, historical or cultural sources for inspiration. This is where character concept ideas begin to take shape.</p>
   
        <h4><b>2. Concept development</b></h4>
        <p>Based on the collected references, the artist begins working on sketches, creating the first ideas for the character. This is work on shape and proportions, personality and emotions, clothing elements, and accessories, all of which come together to form the character concept.</p>
   
  
        <h4><b>3. Development of various poses</b></h4>
        <p>To better understand how the character will move or look in different situations, it is important to develop several poses. These poses will help in the future to model the character taking into account the dynamics of movement.</p>
 

        <h4><b>4. Final approval of the concept</b></h4>
        <p>After creating several sketches, it is important to choose one that will serve as the basis for the future 3D character model. This concept is usually approved by the team or the client (in the case of professional development).</p>

    


<h4>P.S.</h4>
<p>Concept art is not just an artistic sketch, it is the basis for all further work.</p>


<h3>Step 2. Modeling the Character</h3>
<p>Once the character concept is ready, you can start modeling. This is one of the most technically complex and creative stages, 
    where the concept turns into a 3D model. Here, you will learn how to make a 3D model that reflects the original design.</p>

    <p>Initially, a basic model of the character is created - this is the starting version, which does not have many details,
         but already reflects the main forms and proportions. At this stage, it is important to lay down the basic anatomy - 
         the body, proportions, basic forms.
    </p>

    <p>Once the main volume and proportions are established, the retopology process follows - this is the processing of 
        a high-polygon model (if sculpting was used) into a more optimized version for animation.
    </p>

    <p>It is important that the topology lines follow the natural curves of the body, which will make the animation smoother.
        At this stage, the model begins to acquire more details, which makes it more recognizable and closer to the final look. 
        There is a transition to the stage of face modeling, the formation of textures and folds, detailing of clothes and accessories.
        </p>

        <p>Most characters are modeled symmetrically, especially in the early stages. This makes the process easier, since one side
             can be mirrored onto the other. Most 3D programs (e.g. Blender, ZBrush, Maya) have tools for symmetrical work, allowing
              you to model both sides at the same time.
        </p>

        <p>Once the model is ready, it needs to be prepared for texture application. UV unwrapping is the process of unwrapping a 
            3D model into 2D space so that textures can be applied. The unwrapping should take into account details, such as 
            seams on clothing or folds in the skin, so that the textures look natural.
        </p>

        <p>Next, we check the proportions and details. At this stage, it is important to check and make sure that all parts of the
             character are proportional, there are no distortions or errors in the topology, and that the details match the concept. 
             Once the basic model is complete, you can move on to the next stage.
        </p>

        </div>

        <h3>Step 3. Adding Details and Textures</h3>

        <p>When the basic shape of the 3D character is ready, the next important step is adding details and textures. 
            This is the stage where the character becomes more realistic and expressive.
        </p>

        <p>The next step is adding small details to make the 3D character more realistic. 
            The 3D artist works on such details as wrinkles, clothing texture, hair, nails, etc.
        </p>

        <p>Then we work on textures - these are images that are superimposed on the 3D model, giving it depth and realism.
             For example, the skin texture can include roughness, spots, pigmentation, the texture of clothing fabrics - folds and stretches. 
             Textures can be created manually or by scanning real objects.
        </p>

        <p>At the next stage, the artist also applies various materials and shaders to simulate the behavior of the model's 
            surface in different lighting conditions. For example, skin can be matte, clothing - with a slight shine, and metal -
             with reflections.
        </p>

        <p>And finally - the arrangement of lighting. With the right lighting, the 3D character will look different depending on 
            how the light falls on the textures and shaders. It is important to test different light sources and their 
            placement to ensure that the character will look as natural as possible under different conditions.
        </p>

        <h3> Step 4. Rigging Animation</h3>

        <p>Once the character is ready and the textures are in place, the next step is animation rigging. 
            This is the process of creating the internal structure that allows the model to be animated. This step involves creating the bones, 
            joints, and controllers that allow the character to move in space.
            The first step in rigging is creating the character's skeleton. It consists of bones that connect the various parts of the body
             and allow for proper movement. The skeleton must be positioned precisely so that the character's movements look natural.
            </p>

            <p>Once the skeleton is created, the model must be linked to the bones. This process is called skinning.
                 The essence of it is that each vertex of the model (a point on the surface) is associated with a specific bone.
                  Depending on how the bone moves, the vertex moves, and the model is animated.
            </p>

            <p>Next, for ease of animation and future work with the model, special controllers are created that allow the artist 
                to manipulate the poses and movements of the character without having to work with each bone manually. 
                These controllers simplify the animation process by providing quick and accurate access to the necessary areas of the model.
            </p>

            <p>If the character is to be animated with facial expressions, the next step is to create special elements to control facial expressions.
                 Morphing or additional bones are used to create different emotions, such as smiling, sad or angry.
            </p>

            <p>Once the rigging is complete, it is important to test the model.</p>

            <h3>Step 5. Animation Basics for bringing a character to life.</h3>

            <p>Once the character is ready for animation, the next important step is creating movements that bring it to life and make it dynamic. 
                This step requires attention and knowledge of basic principles of animation to make the character's 
                movements look natural and believable.
            </p>

            <p>Animation begins with creating key poses that represent important moments in the character's movement. These poses establish the main 
                points of the animation, such as the beginning, end,
                 and intermediate phases of the action.
            </p>

            <p>Once the key poses are created, the next step is interpolation - the process of smoothly transitioning between them.
                Modern 3D packages use automatic filling of intermediate frames, but to achieve naturalness, it is important to
                 manually adjust the movement to eliminate possible jerks or artificial transitions.
            </p>

            <p>Next comes working with the timeline. With its help, you can control the speed and duration of each action,
                 adjusting the movements to a specific task or scene.
            </p>

            <p>To make animation more believable, it is important to use basic animation principles such as "stretch and squeeze", 
                "transitions", "bounce", "skew", "slow down and speed up". These principles help to add dynamics and 
                improve the perception of movement.
            </p>

            <p>Animation also includes working with facial expressions and movements that should reflect the character's personality 
                and emotional state.
            </p>

            <p>And finally - testing and adjustments. When the basic animation is ready, it is important to thoroughly
                test the character's movements. It is important to see how the character moves in the context of the scene, 
                interacts with the environment and how it is perceived by the viewer.
            </p>

                        <h3>Fun facts!</h3>
                        <p class="fun-fact-content">1. Did you know that the first 3D character created in history was not a person or an animal,
                             but... a cube? In 1972, "The Computer Generated Character" was created in computer graphics - a simple cube, which
                             became the first step to creating all those realistic and detailed 3D heroes that we see today!
                        </p>
                        <p class="fun-fact-content">2. Did you know that one of the first examples of using 3D characters in animation was created in 1973 in the short film "A 
                            Computer Animated Hand". This experimental project was so technologically complex that it used only one 3D character - a hand,
                             and the entire animation process took months! This clearly demonstrates how labor-intensive and expensive the process of creating 
                             3D animation was compared to simpler and faster 2D characters.</p>

    <h3>Fun facts!</h3>

    <p class="fun-fact-content">Many famous 3D characters that have become legends in the gaming industry were actually created by external studios through outsourcing! 
        For example, CD Projekt Red, the creators of the famous "The Witcher 3", actively used the services of outsourcing studios to develop secondary characters,
         textures, and even some models.
    </p>
    <p>Moreover, in "AAA" level projects, up to 70% of the work on 3D characters and environments can be outsourced! This allows the main studio
         to focus on the main characters and the overall concept, while the partners take care of less visible, but no less important details.
    </p>
    <p>The moral? Even the most outstanding games are often the result of global teamwork, where outsourcing plays a key role!
